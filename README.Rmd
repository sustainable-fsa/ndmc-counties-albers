## üóÇÔ∏è Simplified TopoJSON Version

A simplified version of the `FSA_Counties_dd17` dataset is included in this repository as `fsa-counties-dd17.topojson`. This version was created to reduce geometric complexity and ensure compatibility with common web mapping tools.

### üîß Processing Steps

This workflow processes the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) county definitions to produce a clean, simplified, and TopoJSON-compatible version of the dataset, suitable for use in web mapping applications.

#### 1. Load and Preprocess FSA County Data
- Load the original county boundaries from a zipped file geodatabase:  
  `FSA_Counties_dd17.gdb.zip`
- Exclude U.S. territories by filtering out counties with `FIPSST` codes:
  - American Samoa (`60`), Guam (`66`), Northern Mariana Islands (`69`), Puerto Rico (`72`), U.S. Virgin Islands (`78`), etc.
- Retain only the `FSA_STCOU` field and rename it to `id` for clarity.

#### 2. Normalize Geometries
- Perform a **round-trip** to GeoJSON:
  - Write the filtered data to a temporary `.geojson` file.
  - Read it back into R using `sf::read_sf()`.
- This step removes non-standard geometries (e.g., curved edges or arcs) that may interfere with simplification or projection.

#### 3. Transform and Simplify Geometries
- Project all features to the WGS84 coordinate reference system.
- Use `rmapshaper::ms_explode()` to break multi-part polygons into single-part features.
- Recombine features by `id` using `ms_dissolve()` to ensure unique county geometries.
- Apply `ms_simplify(keep = 0.01)` to reduce geometric complexity while preserving topology.

#### 4. Clip to Official TIGER/Line Boundaries
- Download generalized U.S. county boundaries via the `tigris` package:
  - Use `cb = TRUE` and `resolution = "5m"` for cartographic accuracy.
- Use `ms_explode()` and `ms_dissolve()` to produce a clean national boundary.
- Clip FSA geometries to the national boundary using `ms_clip()`, removing slivers and enforcing alignment.

#### 5. Further Geometry Cleaning
- Use `sf::st_make_valid()` to repair any topological errors.
- Repeat explode/dissolve operations as needed to clean up geometry structure.
- Reposition Alaska, Hawaii, and outlying areas using `tigris::shift_geometry()` for optimal layout in web maps.
- Convert all features to `MULTIPOLYGON` geometries.
- Sort features by `id` to ensure consistent ordering.

#### 6. Export Cleaned Data
- Save the cleaned and simplified geometries to `fsa-counties-dd17.geojson`.

#### 7. Post-process with Mapshaper (CLI)
- Use Mapshaper to:
  - Clean and reorient geometry: `-clean rewind`
  - Derive a new `state` field from the first two characters of `id`:  
    `-each 'state=id.slice(0,2)'`
  - Merge counties into states: `-dissolve field=state`
  - Rename layers: `counties` and `states`
  - Quantize coordinates for TopoJSON compression: `quantization=1e5`
- Export the result as `fsa-counties-dd17.topojson`.

#### 8. Cleanup
- Remove the temporary GeoJSON file to tidy the workspace.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  Unzip the `FSA_Counties_dd17.gdb.zip` file.
2.  Open the `.gdb` in a GIS software environment such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org) or [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview).
3.  Use the layer properties to explore attributes and spatial coverage.

## üìç Quick Start: Visualize the FSA_Counties_dd17 topojson data in R

This snippet shows how to load the fsa-counties-dd17.topojson file from the archive and create a simple map using `sf` and `ggplot2`.

```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', dpi=300, fig.path = './'}
# Load required libraries
library(sf)
library(ggplot2) # For plotting
library(tigris)  # For state boundaries
library(rmapshaper) # For innerlines function

## üìå Background

The dataset originates from the **dd17** schema, a legacy geospatial data standard used by the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) for structuring county-level datasets. It served as a spatial index for county-level geospatial products and was used in conjunction with the **Common Land Unit (CLU)** framework.

While the dataset may no longer be updated or actively distributed by the USDA, it remains of historical and analytical interest ‚Äî particularly for referencing USDA program boundaries, disaster assistance eligibility, and other geospatial analysis across agriculture and conservation.
